    Why this project?

This project was the first in a course I took for General Assembly, utilizing skills and research methods we had learned in 2.5 weeks.


    Approach and Technology:

I chose a functional approach utilizing JQuery, Javascript, CSS, and HTML. 
An Object-Oriented-Programming approach would likely have been cleaner, but the order in which I built out the functions made it easy to stay organized without adopting this direction. 


    Unsolved Problems: 

*CSS spacing is not ideal
*Did not finish making the dance button work over and over, instead of just once
*Buttons are not clickable in their whole surface area
*Interval timers interrupt the screen going black when the monster dies, as designed
*Wanted to add more animations with the evolving of monster, couldn't get egg to explode
*Upon entering, monster is outside screen for half a second


    User story:

Stage 1: 

Player will see cell-phone shaped box that is styled.

Player will click a button on the screen and entering name, and the game will begin. 

Name of monster will === entered name, shown somewhere.

An egg will appear on the screen with the corresponding buttons and icons.

Age will appear, starting at 1.

A timer will start for age, health bar, exhaustion, and loneliness.

All but age will decrease over time.

If any reach 0, the game ends and the monster dies.

Clicking radiation button will increase health.

Texting will increase social meter.

Button to play music for monster so they dance.



Stage 2: 

If enough time passes, monster will break out of egg.
